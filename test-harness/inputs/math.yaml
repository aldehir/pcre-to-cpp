  Theorem: The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2.

  Proof (by induction):
  Base case: n = 1
    Sum = 1 = 1(1+1)/2 = 1 ✓

  Inductive step: Assume true for n = k:
    1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2

  Prove for n = k+1:
    1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1)
    = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)
    = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2
    = ((k+1)(k+2))/2
    = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2 ✓

  Therefore, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all n ∈ ℕ. ∎

  Quantum mechanics - Schrödinger equation:
  iℏ(∂ψ/∂t) = Ĥψ

  Where:
  - ψ is the wave function
  - ℏ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π)
  - Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator: Ĥ = -(ℏ²/2m)∇² + V(r,t)

  Time-independent form:
  Ĥψ = Eψ

  This is an eigenvalue equation where E represents energy eigenvalues.
